<!--l. 6165--><p class="noindent" >Free Pascal supports thread programming: There is a language construct available for thread-local
storage (<span 
class="cmtt-10">ThreadVar</span>), and cross-platform low-level thread routines are available for those operating
systems that support threads.
<!--l. 6170--><p class="noindent" >All routines for threading are available in the system unit, under the form of a thread manager. A
thread manager must implement some basic routines which the RTL needs to be able to support
threading. For Windows, a default threading manager is integrated in the system unit. For
other platforms, a thread manager must be included explicitly by the programmer. On
systems where posix threads are available, the <span 
class="cmss-10">cthreads </span>unit implements a thread manager
which uses the C POSIX thread library. No native pascal thread library exists for such
systems.
<!--l. 6179--><p class="noindent" >Although it is not forbidden to do so, it is not recommended to use system-specific threading
routines: The language support for multithreaded programs will not be enabled, meaning that
threadvars will not work, the heap manager will be confused which may lead to severe program
errors.
<!--l. 6184--><p class="noindent" >If no threading support is present in the binary, the use of thread routines or the creation of a
thread will result in an exception or a run-time error 232.
<!--l. 6187--><p class="noindent" >For <span 
class="cmcsc-10"><span 
class="small-caps">l</span><span 
class="small-caps">i</span><span 
class="small-caps">n</span><span 
class="small-caps">u</span><span 
class="small-caps">x</span> </span>(and other Unixes), the C thread manager can be enabled by inserting the <span 
class="cmtt-10">cthreads</span>
unit in the program&#8217;s unit clause. Without this, threading programs will give an error
when started. It is imperative that the unit be inserted as early in the uses clause as
possible.
<!--l. 6192--><p class="noindent" >At a later time, a system thread manager may be implemented which implements threads without
Libc support.
<!--l. 6195--><p class="noindent" >The following sections show how to program threads, and how to protect access to data common to
all threads using (cross-platform) critical sections. Finally, the thread manager is explained in more
detail.
