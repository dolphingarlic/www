<h2>Target specific issues: Linux</h2>
<p>There are several issues on Linux that need to be taken care of: </p>
<p>The Linux version of the <span class="file">Graph</span> unit uses the <span class="file">libvga</span> library. This library works on the console, not under X. </p>
<p>If you get an error similar to </p>
<pre><span class="sym">/</span>usr<span class="sym">/</span>bin<span class="sym">/</span>ld<span class="sym">:</span> cannot find <span class="sym">-</span>lvga
</pre>
<p>This can mean one of two things: either libvga and it's development package is not installed properly, or the directory where it is installed is not in the linker path. </p>
<p>To remedy the former, you should install both the libvga package and libvga-devel package (or compile and install from scratch). </p>
<p>To remedy the latter, you should add the path to the compiler command-line using the <var>-Fl</var> option. </p>
<p>Programs using <span class="file">libvga</span> need root privileges to run. You can make them setuid root with the following command: </p>
<pre>chown root<span class="sym">.</span>root myprogram
chmod u<span class="sym">+</span>s myprogram
</pre>
<p>The libvga library will give up the root privileges after it is initialized. </p>
<p>there is an experimental version of the Graphics library available that uses GGI to do all the drawing, but it is not well tested. It's called <span class="file">ggigraph</span> and is distributed in source form only. </p>
<p>Do not use the CRT unit together with the Graph unit: the console may end up in an unusable state. Instead, the <span class="file">ncurses</span> unit may function fine. </p>
