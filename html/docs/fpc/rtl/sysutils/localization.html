<h2>Localization support</h2>
<p>Localization support depends on various constants and structures being initialized correctly. On Windows and OS/2 this is done automatically: a widestring manager is installed by default which helps taking care of the current locale when performing various operations on strings. The various internationalization settings (date/time format, currency, language etc) are also initialized correctly on these platforms. </p>
<p>On unixes, the widestring support is in a separate unit: <span class="file">cwstring</span>, which loads the various needed  functions from the C library. It should be added manually to the uses clause of your program. No internationalization (or localisation) settings are   applied by this unit, these must be initialized separately by including the <span class="file">clocale</span> unit in the uses clause of your program. </p>
