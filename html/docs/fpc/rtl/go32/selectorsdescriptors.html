<h2>Selectors and descriptors</h2>
<p>Descriptors are a bit like real mode segments; they describe (as the name implies) a memory area in protected mode. A descriptor contains information about segment length, its base address and the attributes of it (i.e. type, access rights, ...). These descriptors are stored internally in a so-called descriptor table, which is basically an array of such descriptors. Selectors are roughly an index into this table. Because these 'segments' can be up to 4 GB in size, 32 bits aren't sufficient anymore to describe a single memory location like in real mode. 48 bits are now needed to do this, a 32 bit address and a 16 bit sized selector. The GO32 unit provides the tseginfo record to store such a pointer. But due to the fact that most of the time data is stored and accessed in the %ds selector, FPC assumes that all pointers point to a memory location of this selector. So a single pointer is still only 32 bits in size. This value represents the offset from the data segment base address to this memory location. </p>
