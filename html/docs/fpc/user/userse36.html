<!--l. 2415--><p class="noindent" >Free Pascal is designed to be cross-platform. This means that the basic RTL units are usable on all
platforms, and the compiler behaves the same on all platforms (as far as possible). The
Object Pascal language is the same on all platforms. Nevertheless, FPC comes with a lot
of units that are not portable, but provide access to all possibilities that a platform
provides.
<!--l. 2422--><p class="noindent" >The following are some guidelines to consider when writing portable code:
     <ul class="itemize1">
     <li class="itemize">Avoid system-specific units. The system unit, the objects and classes units and the
     SysUtils unit are guaranteed to work on all systems. So is the DOS unit, but that is
     deprecated.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Avoid direct hardware access. Limited, console-like hardware access is available for
     most platforms in the Video, Mouse and Keyboard units.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Do not use hard-coded filename conventions. See below for more information on this.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Make no assumptions on the internal representation of types. Various processors store
     information in different ways (&#8217;endianness&#8217;).
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">If system-specific functionality is needed, it is best to separate this out in a single unit.
     Porting efforts will then be limited to re-implementing this unit for the new platform.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Don&#8217;t  use  assembler,  unless  you  have  to.  Assembler  is  processor  specific.  Some
     instructions will not work even on the same processor family.
     </li>
     <li class="itemize">Do not assume that pointers and integers have the same size. They do on an Intel 32-bit
     processor, but not necessarily on other processors. The <span 
class="cmtt-10">PtrInt </span>type is an alias for the
     integer type that has the same size as a pointer. <span 
class="cmtt-10">SizeInt </span>is used for all size-related
     issues.</li></ul>
<!--l. 2445--><p class="noindent" >The system unit contains some constants which describe file access on a system:

     platforms, and <span
