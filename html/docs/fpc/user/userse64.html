     Objecive-C and Java classes can be imported formally, without using the the unit in which it

     entity of this class type (such as access one of its fields, send a message to it, or use
     it to inherit from), the compiler requires the full definition of the class to be in

     Java does not automatically add inherited constructors to child classes, so that they can be

     required to add a public, parameterless constructor. In Java, constructors are
     nameless, but in FPC they are all called &#8220;Create&#8221;. Therefore, if you do not add a
     constructor to a Java class and furthermore use the &#8220;Create&#8221; identifier for another
     entity (e.g., a field, or a parameterless method), the compiler cannot satisfy this
     requirement.
