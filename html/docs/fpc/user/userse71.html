     While you pointed the compiler to a file containing whole program optimization feedback,

     The compiler was not instructed to perform any whole program optimizations (no
     -Owxxx parameters), but nevertheless an input file with such feedback was specified
     (using -Fwyyy). Since this can indicate that you forgot to specify an -Owxxx parameter,
     the compiler generates an error in this case.

     The feedback file contains multiple sections that provide the same class of information
     (e.g., information about which virtual methods can be devirtualized). In this case, the
     information in last encountered section is used. Turn on debugging output (-vd) to see
     which class of information is provided by each section.

     Certain symbol liveness collectors need a helper program to extract the symbol information

     An error occurred during the reading of the symbol liveness file that was generated
     using the &#8217;nm&#8217; or &#8217;objdump&#8217; program. The reason can be that it was shorter than
     expected, or that its format was not understood.

     Certain symbol liveness collectors need a helper program to extract the symbol information
     from the linked program. The helper program produced the reported error code when
     it was run on the linked program.

<span 
class="cmbx-10">Error: Collection of symbol liveness information can only help when using smart linking, use -CX -XX</span> </dt><dd 
class="description">
     Whether or not a symbol is live is determined by looking whether it exists in the final
     linked program. Without smart linking/dead code stripping, all symbols are always
     included, regardless of whether they are actually used or not. So in that case all symbols
     will be seen as live, which makes this optimization ineffective.
