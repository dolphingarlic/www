<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>This package contains a library to easily work with Microsoft Windows resources in a cross-platform way.</p>
<p>Classes are provided to create, load and write resources from/to different file formats in a transparent way, and to handle most common resource types without having to deal with their internal format.</p>
<p>Whenever possible data caching is performed, helped by a copy-on-write mechanism. This improves performance especially when converting big resources from a file format to another.</p>
<p>Since fcl-res architecture is extensible, it's always possible to extend the library with custom resource types or new file readers/writers.</p>
<p>Please note that resources aren't limited to Windows platform: Free Pascal can use them also on ELF and Mach-O targets. Moreover, this library can be useful for cross-compilation purposes even on other targets.</p>
<p>It is highly recommended to read <b>Basic Usage</b> topic if you are approaching this library for the first time.</p>
